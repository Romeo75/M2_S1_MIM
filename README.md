### Objectives 

This course introduces experimental and theoretical methods for materials properties investigation from the physicist point of view. The goals are the following: 
* to provide the graduate student, whether more experimentalist or more theoretician, a good knowledge and comprehension of the physics behind the experimental and theoretical approaches currently used in materials science
* to make the graduate student capable to define and carry out experimental/theoretical protocols to address a scientific problem in materials science
* to provide a strong physical background for the practical works that are carried out in the LabS teaching unit

### Content 
 
* Description of the probes experimentally used to investigate materials properties (photons from infra‐red to hard X-rays, electrons and thermal neutrons); presentation of the light‐matter interactions including the connections between microscopic mechanisms and macroscopic responses; interaction cross sections, electronic transition selection rules, angular dependence
* Presentation of the following experimental methods, dedicated to studies of structural, electronic and vibrational properties of materials (bulk crystals, nanosized materials, surfaces, ...):  
  * x‐ray and neutrons diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy 
  * IR absorption spectroscopy, Raman and Brillouin scattering, x-ray and neutron inelastic scattering  
  * photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, UPS, ARPES) 
  * scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) 
* Description of the theoretical methods used to model/predict materials properties (ab initio vs classical):  
  * Density Functional Theory (DFT), Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT), 
  * Statistical sampling and thermodynamics, Metadynamics 
  * Atomistic simulations (Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations) 

### Prerequisites 
 
* Geometrical crystallography: lattice points and motif, lattice systems, Bravais lattices, conventional crystal cells, crystallographic point groups, space groups, Miller indices, crystal direction, lattice plane, Bragg planes, reciprocal lattice, Brillouin zone, etc. 
* Maxwell equations, quantum mechanics and atomic physics (time‐dependent perturbation theory, Fermi golden rule, harmonic oscillator, second quantization, Dirac and Schrödinger representations, spherical harmonics, kinetic moments coupling), statistical mechanics
